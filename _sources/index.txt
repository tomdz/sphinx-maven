Introduction
============

The *sphinx-maven* plugin is a `Maven site plugin`_ that uses `Sphinx`_ to generate the main documentation.
Sphinx itself was origially created by the Python community for the new Python documentation. It uses a
plain text format called `reStructured Text`_ which it then compiles into a variety of documentation formats
such as HTML, LaTeX (for PDF), epub. reStructured Text is similar to `Markdown`_ but - at least via Sphinx -
has better support for multi-page documentation.

The *sphinx-maven* plugin is BSD licensed just as Sphinx itself is.
