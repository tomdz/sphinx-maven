Updating Sphinx
===============

The project comes with a bash script which will update the embedded sphinx installation
automatically. Simple invoke it like so::

    ./src/main/build/update-sphinx.sh

How the update script works
---------------------------

1. It sets up a temporary working directory ``target/sphinx-tmp`` and cd's into it.
2. It downloads the Jython installer for version 2.5.2 from Sourceforge.
3. It downloads the ``ez_setup.py`` script which will setup ``easy_install``.
4. It installs Jython in the temporary directory.
5. It installs ``easy_install`` in the temporary directory.
6. It uses ``easy_install`` to install ``docutils``, ``pygments``, ``jinja2``, ``sphinx``, and ``rst2pdf``.
7. ``rst2pdf`` depends on ``ReportLab``, but unfortunatly that won't install
   directly with ``easy_install``. The reason for that is that by default it is
   trying to install native extensions which won't work on Jython. To workaround
   that, the script downloads the ``ReportLab`` distribution directly, unpacks it,
   removes the native extensions (the setup script will be fine with it), and then
   runs the installation manually.
8. ``rst2pdf`` itself also has a bug with Pyton (see this `rst2pdf bug`_) which we'll
   patch and then trigger Jython to pre-compile the module again.
9. Finally, we create the ``sphinx.jar`` out of the installed modules, and move it to
   ``src/main/resources`` (which will cause it to be included as a file in the plugin).

Running normal Sphinx
---------------------

If you want to compare to the normal sphinx, install it like this::

    easy_install sphinx rst2pdf

and run Sphinx like so in your project's root directory::

    sphinx-build -v -a -E -n -b html src/site/sphinx target/site
    sphinx-build -a -E -n -b pdf src/site/sphinx target/site/pdf
